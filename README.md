# AMR STUDY.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a major threat to human health with significant global economic and security implications. In 2015, WHO Member States unanimously approved a Global Action Plan to tackle AMR (GAP-AMR). The goal of GAP-AMR is “to ensure, for as long as possible, continuity of successful treatment and prevention of infectious diseases with effective and safe medicines that are quality-assured, used in a responsible way, and accessible to all who need them”.   
   ## I have learnt about ESKAPEE Pathogens which include
   ---
   - *Staphylococcus aureus*
   - *Enterococcus faecium*
   - *Escherichia coli*
   - *Klebsiella pneumoniae*
   - *Pseudomonas aureginosa*
   - *Enterobacter cloacae*
   - *Acinetobacter baumanii*
     The picture below shows *S aureus*

Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive, catalase-positive coccus, 0.5–1.5 µm in diameter, which forms clusters of cells appearing as characteristic 'bunches of grapes' when viewed microscopically. In laboratory media like sheep blood agar, it has an optimum temperature for growth of 37 °C with a range of 7–48 °C.

**signs and symptoms** 

*S. aureus* can also cause serious infections such as pneumonia (infection of the lungs) or bacteremia (bloodstream infection). Symptoms of these infections include difficulty breathing, malaise, fever, or chills.

### Resistance genes
The blaZ gene, which is the most common beta lactam (Penicillinase) resistance mechanism for S. aureus, was observed in 88.7% of the methicillin susceptible S. aureus, while methicillin resistance mediated by the mec gene was present in 13.6%.
